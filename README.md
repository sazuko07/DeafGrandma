# Lessons Learned
1. follow the order of execution. always be aware of where you are in the program.
2. make sure there are no errant ";" operators, because it causes methods/loops to fail.
3. I hate curly braces with a flaming passion
4. follow the "stories". dont try to code everything at once. build from the ground up.
5. dont be afraid to ask for help, or look up specific things to help your code.
